# 1.1 Introduction

__Algorithm Definition:__ A well-defined computational procedure that takes some value or a set of values as input and produces some value or a set of values as output, in a finite time.

__Problem Instance__: An instance of a problem consists of a specific input to a computational problem.

An algorithm is correct if, for every problem instance provided as input, it halts -finishes computing in finite time- and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance.

__Data Structure__: A way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

Using  the appropriate data structures is an important part of algorithm design.

When an algorithm is mentioned, it is assumed that all of the input data is available when the algorithm starts running. Algorithms that receive their input over time are called __online algorithms__.

__Record__ (Sorting Algorithms): Numbers to be sorted are called __keys__. Keys are associated with other data, called __satellite data__. Together, a key and associated data form a __record__.
