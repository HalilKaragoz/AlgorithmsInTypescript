# AlgorithmsInTypescript

Common algorithms implemented in Typescript
This is a work in progress...

I plan to:
  Add notes on time complexity calculations, order of growth and other mathematical aspects of computer algorithms.
  Add time complexity calculations for each algorithm.
  Add support for complex data types, generics and custom sort conditions
  Include a new algorithm every week on average.
