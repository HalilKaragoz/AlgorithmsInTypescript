# AlgorithmsInTypescript  

Common algorithms implemented in Typescript  
This is a work in progress...  
  
* I plan to: 
    * Add notes on time complexity calculations, order of growth and other mathematical aspects of computer algorithms.
    * Add time complexity calculations for each algorithm.  
    * Add support for complex data types, generics and custom sort conditions. 
    * Include a new algorithm every week on average.
